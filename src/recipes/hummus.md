## Preparation

Place the chickpeas in a bowl with plenty of water and add about 3 heaped tea
spoons of salt. Soak overnight in the fridge.

The next day, poor off the water and rinse the chickpeas.

Bring the chickpeas, the cloves of garlic and the bay leaf to the boil in 500ml
of water. Do not add any extra salt. Let this simmer for about an hour. Then
pour off the water and set it aside, it's needed in the next step.

Remove the bay leaf. Set some chickpeas aside to use as garnish. Put the
remaining chickpeas and garlic in a food processor. Add a few table spoons of
tahini and enough of the chickpea water for the food processor to do its thing.
You can add water, you can't take it out. Add a couple of grinds of fresh black
pepper and blend to a creamy mixture.

Garnish the dish with the chickpeas you set aside before and a drizzle some nice
olive oil over the top.
