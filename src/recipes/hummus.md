## Ingredients

  - 200g dried chickpeas
  - 3-4 cloves of garlic
  - 1 large bay leaf
  - salt
  - 8 tbsp tahini
  - black pepper

## Preparation

Place the chickpeas in a bowl with plenty of water and add about 3 heaped tea
spoons of salt. Soak overnight in the fridge.

The next day poor the water away and rinse the chickpeas.

Bring the chickpeas, the cloves of garlic and the bay leaf to the boil in about
400ml of water. Do not add any extra salt. Let this simmer for about an hour.
Then pour off the water, but save it, it's needed in the next step.

Remove the bay leaf and put the chickpeas and garlic in a food processor. Add a
few table spoons of tahini and enough water for the food processor to do its
thing. You can add water, you can't take it out. Add a couple of grinds of fresh
black pepper and blend to a creamy mixture.
