title: Hummus
ingredients:
  - 120g dried chickpeas
  - 1-2 cloves of garlic
  - salt
  - 2-3 tbsp tahini
  - black pepper
---

## Preparation

Place the chickpeas in a bowl with plenty of water and add about 3 heaped tea
spoons of salt. Soak overnight in the fridge.

The next day, poor off the water and rinse the chickpeas.

Bring the chickpeas to the boil in 500ml of water. Do not add any extra salt.
Let this simmer for about an hour. Then drain the water and set it aside as it's
needed in the next step.

Put some chickpeas to the side to use as garnish. Put the remaining chickpeas
and pealed garlic in a food processor. Add a few table spoons of tahini and
enough of the chickpea water you set aside earlier for the food processor to do
its thing. You can add water, you can't take it out. Add a couple of grinds of
fresh black pepper and blend to a creamy mixture.

Garnish the dish with the chickpeas you put to the side and drizzle some nice
olive oil over the top.

## Changelog

- Don't add garlic and bayleaf when boiling the chickpeas
- Add raw garlic to the food processor
