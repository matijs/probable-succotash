title: Apple cake
ingredients:
  - 225g butter

  - 4 eggs
  - pinch of salt
  - 225g self-raising flour
  - 1 tablespoon of cinnamon
  - 1 teaspoon of ginger powder
  - 2 apples

Pre-heat a fan-assisted oven to 160ºC.

Put the butter and caster sugar in a bowl and mix to a smooth mixture. I always
forget to melt butter beforehand so I usually melt it in the microwave. If you
do this, make sure the butter does not actually get warm. Just under a minute
should do the trick.

Mix in the eggs (this is why you do not want warm butter), self-raising flour,
and a pinch of salt. You want to end up with a smooth but not super runny
mixture. Nobody likes a soggy cake, so you could use just 3 eggs if they are
really big.

Peel and quarter the apples and remove the cores. Half the quarter pieces and
slice these up into even smaller pieces. Sprinkle with the cinnamon and ginger
powder and mix well.

Line a cake tin with greaseproof paper, poor in the the mixture and bake at
160ºC for 1 hour and 20 minutes.

Stick a sharp knife in to see if it comes out clean, if it does not, put the
cake back in for a few more minutes.

Leave the cake to cool down in the tin for about 10 minutes, then lift it out
and leave it to cool further.

Enjoy!
