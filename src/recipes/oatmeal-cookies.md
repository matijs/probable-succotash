## Preparation

Let the butter soften. Mix the butter, the caster sugar, and egg until it makes
an even coloured creamy mixture.

Preheat the oven to 180ÂºC.

Mix the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt into the mixture.
Finally add the raisins and oats and mix well.

Divide the mixture into 12 portions and shape into round cookies on a baking
sheet. Make sure to leave about 5cm around every cookie, they **will** grow!

Bake for about 12 minutes, take the cookies out of the oven and let them cool
down on the baking tray for a few minutes before remove them from the baking
paper with a fish slice and transferring them to a rack to fully cool down.
