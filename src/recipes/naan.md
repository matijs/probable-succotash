title: Naan
serves: 2
ingredients:

  - a splash of water
  - a dash of olive oil
  - good pinch of salt
  - plenty of nigella seeds
---

## Preparation

Add all ingredients together in a bowl. Mix with a spoon first and then knead to
a supple dough, add a splash of water if needed. You can add more water, you
can't take it out.

When you think you're done kneading you're about half way, keep on kneading.

Heat a cast iron pan on the stove. Do **not** use a pan with a non-stick coating
for this, use an oven instead if you don't have a cast iron pan, but really you
should have a cast iron pan.

Divide your bowl of dough into 4 even pieces and roll these out. You can use a
rolling pin but you don't have to. Do not make them too thin or you will end up
with naan biscuits. Cook them, about 3 minutes on each side, in the cast iron
pan or the oven.

Enjoy!

## Changelog

- Use plain flour + baking soda instead of self-raising flour
- Adjust quantities to serve 2 instead of 4
