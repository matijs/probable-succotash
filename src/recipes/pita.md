## Preparation

This recipe is almost the same as the one for naan bread.

Add all ingredients together in a bowl. Don't use more than a quarter spoon of
baking soda unless you like bitter soap. Mix with a spoon and then knead to a
supple dough.

When you think you're done kneading you're about half way, keep on kneading but
now would be a good time to pre-heat the grill.

Divide your dough into 2 even pieces and shape them into pita sized circles with
your fingers or use a rolling pin. As with the naans, do not make them too thin
or you will end up with biscuits.

Cook them under the grill for about 2-3 minutes on each side.
